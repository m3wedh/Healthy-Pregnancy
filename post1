<h2>Is It Important To Add Any Supplements To Your Indian Pregnancy Diet?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor will tell you whether or not you need to add any supplements to your diet while you are pregnant. Here are a few conditions in which your doctor may feel you would need a supplement, so make sure that you discuss it with your doctor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If you are too nauseous, it can be difficult for you to eat properly, especially in the first trimester. Your doctor may suggest that you go for a mineral and vitamin supplement along with your regular food, as it will help to give you the minerals and vitamins that are important during pregnancy.</li><li>If you are a vegetarian or follow any other dietary restrictions due to religious or other reasons, you may be at the risk of contracting some nutritional deficiency. Speak to your doctor about the same to see if you need some supplements.</li><li>One supplement that you will be asked to take while you are pregnant is folic acid. Taking a folic acid supplement while you are pregnant will help prevent various birth defects in your unborn baby, especially neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. Your doctor will most likely prescribe you a folic acid supplement only after you are 12 weeks pregnant.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>In addition to folic acid supplements, your doctor will also prescribe you some iron supplements. Taking an iron supplement will make sure that your body gets the right amount of blood, and you are not deficient in your energy levels. Your doctor will regularly check your iron levels at each appointment to check the dosage of iron supplements that you need.</li><li>Your doctor may also advise you about supplements depending on your medical condition, such as if you are suffering from diabetes, have anemia or have a history of pregnancy complications from earlier pregnancies.</li></ul>

<h2>A Few Tips To Remember While Eating During Your Pregnancy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping a check on what you eat while you are pregnant is as important as understanding how you should eat it. Here are a few tips that will be of help, especially while you are pregnant:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>No matter what you want to eat, ensure you consult your doctor first. Something that is healthy for someone else who is pregnant may not be as safe or healthy for you. Your doctor will assess your medical condition and advise you accordingly.</li><li>If you feel uncomfortable after eating something, or notice any rashes or redness on your face or skin, make a note of what you ate and keep it with you. Avoid eating it again and speak to your doctor about it.</li><li>Do not give up on oil, ghee or butter for the fear of gaining excess weight. A little amount of fat is important for both you and your baby and you should have some each day while you are pregnant. If you are overweight, speak to your doctor about how much fat you can safely include in your diet.</li><li>Make sure to have some amount of dry fruits in your everyday diet.</li><li>Use salt in moderation, as having too much salt will make your body retain more water, which can further increase your swelling while you are pregnant.</li><li>Add fruits to your everyday diet as your body will need the natural sugars that are present in fruits. Avoid eating too much sugar otherwise.</li><li>Try to eat at home as much as you can and have fresh homemade food to avoid the risk of infection.</li><li>Avoid eating pre-packaged heat-and-eat meals as these are heavily processed and are not a good food choice while you are pregnant.</li><li>If you are buying a ready to eat a meal from outside, make sure to read the instructions on the package and also read the best before date so that you can eat it before the mentioned date.</li><li>If you are buying a ready to eat meal from outside, make sure to read the instructions on the package and also read the best before date so that you can eat it before the mentioned date.</li><li>If you are going to eat outside, check the ingredients that will be used in whatever meal you are ordering. It will help you identify food items that you are allergic to or that your doctor has asked you to avoid eating while you are pregnant.</li><li>Make sure that while you are eating out, you choose a place that is clean and hygienic and you have food there before. If you want to eat out at a new place, avoid ordering anything exotic, especially if you are not sure about their kitchen and their overall food quality.</li><li>Always inform the chef that you are pregnant so that they are equally wary of what they are making. You can also speak to the chef in person to find out about the ingredients that will be used.</li><li>Wash your hands properly before chopping and cooking, as you can always have the risk of getting sick if your hands are not clean.</li><li>Do not stay hungry and make sure to eat something or the other after every two hours or so, even if you do not feel hungry. While you are pregnant, you will tend to feel nauseous and may not want to eat at all. However, it is important that you keep eating something, especially if you have vomited, as otherwise you have the risk of getting dehydrated. Keep replenishing your body with liquids such as soups, fresh fruit juices or milkshakes.</li><li>To avoid feeling bloated or too full and avoid any nausea attacks, space out your meals to six or seven meal times in the day. Keep the food portions to small portions at each meal time instead of having very big ones.</li><li>Do not try to cut down on food while you are pregnant, thinking that it will help you lose weight later. If you eat right and include the right balance of nutrients in your daily diet while you are pregnant, it will help you reduce the baby fat later with much ease.</li></ol>

<p>Consuming an Indian diet during pregnancy can be beneficial as this diet includes all the food groups. When planned right, an Indian diet could help you meet all the nutrients required for the growth and development of a fetus. Indian meals are versatile; therefore, you can choose the meal combinations you are comfortable with. However, if so many food choices seem overwhelming to you, seek the help of a dietitian to plan your meals. Let them know about your meal preferences, likes, and dislikes to help them plan a balanced diet for you.
