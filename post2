<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Stay hydrated</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will need more fluids during pregnancy as the blood volume increases to support the oxygen and nutrient requirements of the fetus. The sudden changes in the body will increase the demand for fluid intake. You should consider having lots of water, fresh juices, and smoothies to remain hydrated at this time&nbsp;<a href="https://yalehealth.yale.edu/obstetricsprenatal-patients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(1)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Take prenatal vitamins</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take prenatal vitamins as suggested by your doctor. The early pregnancy period is crucial for both the mother and the fetus.&nbsp;<strong>It is essential that you take supplements for folic acid, which is essential to prevent birth defects&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/folic-acid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(2)</a>, and iron that prevents pregnancy anemia.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Quit smoking</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a habitual smoker, now is the time to quit. Smoking increases the risk of several complications such as low immunity, low-birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/ectopic-pregnancy_00475339/">ectopic pregnancy</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029987/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(3)</a>. There is also a risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with second-hand smoking. Therefore, say no to tobacco and avoid passive smoking for a healthy pregnancy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/tobaccousepregnancy/index.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Ftobaccousepregnancy%2Findex.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(4)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Quit alcohol and cut down caffeine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like tobacco, alcohol and caffeine also put the mother and the fetus at risk. Alcohol is known to cause learning disabilities and affect the cognitive functioning of the fetus. Too much caffeine is associated with premature labor and congenital disabilities&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029987/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(3)</a>. Limit colas, sodas, chocolates, green and black tea as they contain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/safe-drink-coffee-pregnancy_002976/">excess caffeine</a>.&nbsp;<strong>According to experts, women should limit their caffeine intake during pregnancy to less than 200 milligrams per day, which is about one 11oz cup of coffee</strong>.</p>

<h3>6. Fish and seafood</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although fish and seafood are healthy sources of proteins and fats, some varieties contain high mercury levels that are dangerous for the fetus. Mercury is associated with brain damage and developmental delays in the baby&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/mercury.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(6)</a>.

<h3>7. Do not miss prenatal OB/GYN visits</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schedule a prenatal appointment soon after your pregnancy is confirmed. It is important to see a qualified gynecologist or obstetrician.<strong>&nbsp;Your doctor might ask about your medical history to understand your health condition better and prescribe medications accordingly</strong>. Communicate with your doctor honestly and regularly and consult them whenever you experience any pain or discomfort&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/should_i_avoid_seafood_while_pregnant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(7)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Manage your weight</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maintain a healthy lifestyle and have a healthy BMI before trying to get pregnant. Being obese increases risks during pregnancy. Also, gaining too much weight suddenly, especially during the first trimester and commencing weeks, is harmful. If required check with a dietitian or a nutritionist for a healthy diet plan&nbsp;<a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/womenshealth/pregnancy-birth/1st-trimester.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(8)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Exercise</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mild and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/exercises-you-should-avoid-during-pregnancy_00122653/">moderate exercises</a>&nbsp;help you stay active and keep your metabolism high. A walk in the park will be good for your health and is refreshing. You should avoid heavy and strenuous activities such as back-bends, stretches, and advanced abdominal moves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, avoid exercises that need you to lie on the back, put pressure on the abdomen and those that lead to overheating and dehydration. Consult your doctor before planning to take up yoga, meditation or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/benefits-of-doing-breathing-exercises-during-pregnancy_00106443/">breathing exercises</a>, or enroll in prenatal workout classes&nbsp;<a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/weight-gain-for-your-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(9)</a>.</p>

<h3>10. Herbs and medications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certain herbal supplements and medications are harmful during pregnancy. Never continue old prescriptions or pills you think are good. They may be harmful and lead to issues such as miscarriage, premature labor, and painful contractions. Always consult your doctor before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/medication-to-avoid-during-pregnancy_00391524/">taking any medication</a>&nbsp;to keep yourself and the baby safe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/discover-health/exercise-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(10)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Avoid hot tubs and sauna baths</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staying in high temperatures for prolonged periods will increase the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561638/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(11)</a>. Hot tubs and saunas cause you to remain in temperatures higher than the basal body temperature. So avoid them and use heat compresses wrapped in a cloth to relieve joint pains and backaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>12. Avoid strong smells</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some pregnant women might experience a heightened sense of smell, especially in the first trimester. This could, therefore, aggravate symptoms such as morning sickness and nausea&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1640616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(12)</a>. Stay away from scents or smells that could trigger nausea or vomiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>13. Limit exposure to pets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have pets at home, limit contact with them as they may carry harmful parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, which is detrimental to the baby’s development. It can affect the brain causing reduced growth and eye defects in the fetus. Animal dander is also known to cause allergic reactions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(13)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>14. Get tested for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pregnant women need to get screened for STDs and HIV in the early pregnancy stage. These infections will have a significant impact on the pregnancy, your health and your baby’s health too. Therefore, you should use contraceptives to avoid the risk of disease&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bu.edu/buohc/files/2009/07/aesp-overview-2-22-07.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(14)</a>.&nbsp; If the tests are positive, early and prompt treatment may cure the infection and also protect the fetus.</p>

<h2>Is Air Travel Safe In The First Trimester?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it is usually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/safe-travel-pregnancy_0031/">safe to fly</a>&nbsp;during the first trimester with nil or minimum high-risk factors, but you should be aware that the likeliness of miscarriage is highest during the first trimester. Also, flying for more than four hours raises the risk of thrombosis (blood clots). Taking the right precautions such as proper hydration, wearing comfortable clothing, calf exercises, and walking around the airplane (if possible) helps make the journey safer&nbsp;<a href="http://hpri.fullerton.edu/Community/documents/STD-Preg-factsheet-August-2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(15)</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/travelling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(16)</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first three months of pregnancy are crucial for fetal development and pregnancy sustenance. Thus, an expecting mother should pay special attention to her lifestyle and its effect on herself and her unborn baby. Eating a well-balanced diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, taking prenatal vitamins, and attending prenatal checkups can help ensure the mother and baby stay healthy. On the other hand, avoiding stress, quitting smoking and alcohol, avoiding non-prescribed herbal supplements or medications, and abstaining from hot tubs and sauna baths could help prevent early pregnancy complications.</p>
