<h2>Medications To Avoid During Pregnancy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following is the list of groups and individual drugs you should avoid as they could have an impact on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/your-unborn-babys-development_00389566/">fetal development</a>. Most of the studies are inconclusive and need further research to confirm the adverse effects of the drugs on the fetus. However, you should never take these drugs without your doctor’s prescription.</p>

<h3>1. Acne medications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vitamin A derivatives such as isotretinoin (Accutane), which is used to treat severe acne, increase the risk of birth defects, cardiac and brain defects, and also physical abnormalities in the baby</strong>. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified this drug under category X, which means there is positive evidence of fetal risk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2001/18662s44lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(1)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oral tetracyclines such as doxycycline (Doryx) used to treat acne, and bacterial infections can cause permanent discoloration of teeth of the baby&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/050795s005lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(2)</a>. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises against the use of these two drugs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/medication-to-avoid-during-pregnancy_00391524/">during pregnancy</a>&nbsp;because of its potential risks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Skin-Conditions-During-Pregnancy?IsMobileSet=false#pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(3)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Antifungal medications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Antifungal medications&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/70/1/14/2911295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(4)</a>, such as fluconazole (Diflucan), are usually prescribed for oral thrush and vaginal fungal infections</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019949s051lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(5)</a>. According to the FDA, the long-term use of high-dose (400-800 mg/day) fluconazole during the first trimester may result in ‘abnormal-looking’ face, oral cleft, bowing thigh bones, thin ribs, long bones, and congenital heart diseases in the infant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communicationuse-long-term-high-dose-diflucan-fluconazole-during-pregnancy-may-be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(6)</a>. However, this risk was not found to be associated with a single dose of fluconazole 150mg to treat vaginal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/preventive-measures-to-avoid-yeast-infection-during-pregnancy_0090064/">yeast infection</a>&nbsp;(candidiasis).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no well-controlled studies of Diflucan in pregnant women, so if you are pregnant or planning to, and need to take Diflucan, then inform your doctor about your pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Antihistamines</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are taken for nasal congestion, hives, rash, and other allergic symptoms. While there are no studies to prove any definite teratogenic effects (effects on the fetus), antihistamines are not categorized under Pregnancy Category A (safe to take during pregnancy)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356948/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(7)</a>. Therefore, you need to discuss the safety of the drugs with your doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) recommend chlorpheniramine and tripelennamine as safe options during pregnancy.</strong>&nbsp;They also recommend cetirizine and loratadine after the first trimester, for patients who cannot tolerate high doses of chlorpheniramine and tripelennamine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356948/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(7)</a>. However, the safety of antihistamines is still under question because of the limited human studies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As most of the antihistamines are available as over-the-counter drugs for motion sickness, and allergies, it is best to consult your doctor before taking them during pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Benzodiazepines</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clonazepam (Klonopin), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), and diazepam (Valium), belonging to the class of benzodiazepines, help treat anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and seizures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FDA has categorized benzodiazepines under Pregnancy Category D, which means that there is a potential risk to the fetus but the drug may be used if the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The antibiotic may not have any adverse effects on the fetus when taken during pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Hungarian population-based study states that the use of chloramphenicol in therapeutic doses during the early&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/stages-of-pregnancy-conception-to-labor_00101527/">stages of pregnancy</a>&nbsp;pose little risk to the developing fetus&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007623408010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(9)</a>. Also, a Danish nationwide cohort study concluded that administering chloramphenicol eye drops or eye ointments during the first trimester was not associated with any major congenital malformations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25923453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(10)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first issue of Clinical Infectious Disease states that there is clinical data that chloramphenicol, when administered during delivery, crosses the placenta and causes grey baby syndrome in the baby&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/30/1/237/322551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(11)</a>, and hence be avoided during labor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Codeine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opioid medication is used for pain and cough. A Scientific Impact Paper by The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) states that opioids could be taken during all stages of pregnancy. However, they have to be taken in the lowest dose for the shortest possible time&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/sip59/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(12)</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Michigan Medicaid study also reported that there was no increased risk of abnormal congenital disabilities in pregnant women exposed to codeine in the first trimester&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(13)</a>. But neonatal withdrawal symptoms are observed in the newborns (in non-addicted mothers) even when therapeutic doses of codeine were taken during the last trimester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Coumadin (warfarin)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The blood-thinning medication is prescribed to treat and prevent clots in the heart, veins, arteries, and lungs. Its intake during the first trimester could lead to a rare condition called fetal warfarin syndrome&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15605910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(14)</a>&nbsp;and is also associated with spontaneous abortions. There could be a risk of central nervous system abnormalities if warfarin is taken at any&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/stages-of-pregnancy-conception-to-labor_00101527/">stage in the pregnancy</a>. For mothers who need to be on long-term warfarin therapy, experts recommend heparin as a substitute&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(16)34689-8/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(15)</a>. Warfarin must be avoided during pregnancy; if you are using this medication, and planning to get pregnant, then talk to your doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Fluoroquinolones</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are another class of antibiotics. The use of fluoroquinolones during early pregnancy was found to have been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/189/17/E625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(16)</a>. While there are no controlled studies on the effects of fluroquinolone (Ciprofloxacin) on pregnant women, animal studies showed adverse effects such as permanent cartilage erosion in weight-bearing joints, and cystic fibrosis&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/bioterrorism-and-drug-preparedness/ciprofloxacin-use-pregnant-and-lactating-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(17)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. NSAIDs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil), diclofenac(Voltaren), naproxen (Naprelan), and piroxicam (Feldene) are prescribed as pain relief options. According to the Scientific Impact Paper by the Royal College of Obstetricians, that NSAIDS should be avoided during pregnancy unless prescribed by the physician. They should be avoided during the first trimester and after 30 weeks of gestation&nbsp;<a href="https://pcwhf.co.uk/news/rcog-review-on-pain-relief-options-for-women-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(18)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of NSAIDs during pregnancy found to result in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.momjunction.com/articles/causes-of-low-birth-weight-in-babies_0091204/">low birth weight</a>&nbsp;in the baby, but the low weight could be attributable to the underlying inflammatory condition than the drug itself. There is a borderline risk with these drugs, so it is good to avoid them during pregnancy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(19)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Primaquine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The antimalarial drug treats malaria caused by Plasmodium virax parasite. Although there are no human studies, there is likely to be a risk of fetal anemia if you have G6PD deficiency&nbsp;<a href="https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+6516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(20)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Sulfonamides</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also referred to as sulfa drugs, they are another group of antibiotics that treat bacterial infections. A population-based case-control study concluded that using Cotrimoxazole (sulfonamide) during pregnancy may increase the risk of cardiovascular malformations, and urinary tract abnormalities&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11738517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(21)</a>. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends doctors to prescribe the antibiotics after discussing the possible outcomes with the mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Sulfonamides-Nitrofurantoin-and-Risk-of-Birth-Defects?IsMobileSet=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(22)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>12. Topiramate</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The anti-epileptic drug is used to treat migraine headaches and other psychiatric illnesses. According to the US FDA, usage during the first trimester could increase the risk of cleft lip or cleft palate in newborns&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/features/birthdefects-topiramate-keyfindings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(23)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FDA also states that oral clefts happen during the early stages of pregnancy (even before the woman knows she is pregnant)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-risk-oral-clefts-children-born-mothers-taking-topamax-topiramate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(24)</a>, so women of childbearing age should talk to physicians for safer options (when on topiramate) if they are planning to get pregnant. Also, you should not stop taking topiramate without talking to your healthcare professional as it can cause health problems to you and the baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>13. Trimethoprim (Primsol)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The antibiotic is used to treat bladder infections. The Best Practice Journal’s ‘<em>Managing urinary tract infections in pregnancy</em>’ states that there are no controlled studies to support the use of trimethoprim during pregnancy. So, it is recommended to avoid this medication during the first trimester as it may increase the risk of neural tube defects&nbsp;<a href="https://bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2011/april/docs/bpj_35_utis_in_pregnancy_pages_20-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(25)</a>. A study using the Danish fertility database found an association between the use of trimethoprim in the 12 weeks before conception and doubling of the rate of congenital malformations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2013/364526/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(26)</a>. However, further investigation is needed to confirm the chances of adverse effects. So, talk to your doctor if you are on such medications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some of these medicines are a clear no during pregnancy, some may be given by the doctor if they think the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to be extra careful while taking over-the-counter medications as they can be purchased without a prescription. Certain OTC drugs to avoid are Aspirin, bismuth subsalicylate, ibuprofen, and Naproxen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medications need not always be the first line of treatment in the case of minor disturbances such as a headache, nausea, joint pains, and constipation during pregnancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Things To Consider Before You Consume OTC Medications</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are a few things to consider before going for a pill, especially when you are pregnant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Try natural measures:</strong>&nbsp;Most of the physical illnesses you experience during pregnancy may be reduced with natural remedies. For examples, you can meditate to get relief from stress or have a massage done for body aches. You may consume a hot soup for cold or take enough rest for a fever.</li><li><strong>Check with your doctor:</strong>&nbsp;Before you plan to take any medication, seek your doctor’s help. They may suggest the lowest possible dose depending on your condition.</li><li><strong>Do not take combination drugs:</strong>&nbsp;Do not mix two different medications, and take them together. You can only do that on your doctor’s prescription.</li><li><strong>Read the label:</strong>&nbsp;While most of the components of the OTC medicines are not harmful, it is good to know about them by reading the label.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some medicines can have adverse effects on you or the developing fetus if consumed during pregnancy. There is a lot of misinformation about the safety and risks of these medicines on the internet. You should consult your doctor before consuming any medication during pregnancy. This list of medications to be avoided during pregnancy will help you understand the strict contraindications. However, your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines for specific health conditions. They will weigh risks versus benefits before prescribing a drug. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor if you have any doubts or apprehensions.</p>
